# Lovok

Lovok is an open source library that is being developed to perform mp4 file validation. A validated mp4 means that it has no malware or any other malicious intent that could cause issues on a userâ€™s device. It is intended to be built as a dynamic library and implemented on mobile applications.

*Note: This project is currently in development and is expected to be finished in 12/2022. Build instructions and additional details will be added as development progresses.*
